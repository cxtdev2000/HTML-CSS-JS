                    In the early days of the World Wide Web, the concept of web 
                    design was inextricably linked to the limitations of HTML. 
                    Pages were static, serving primarily as digital documents 
                    rather than the interactive applications we know today. This 
                    era was defined by simplicity, where the focus was purely on 
                    the dissemination of information without the complexities of modern 
                    frameworks.

                <p>As technology advanced, so did our ability to style these documents. 
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) introduced a separation of content and 
                    presentation, allowing designers to break free from the constraints of 
                    table-based layouts. This shift not only improved accessibility but also 
                    paved the way for the rich, visual storytelling that characterizes the 
                    modern web. We moved from grey backgrounds and blue links to immersive 
                    digital experiences.

                    However, with the rise of complex JavaScript frameworks and dynamic content, 
                    there has been a noticeable return to minimalism. Designers and developers 
                    are once again appreciating the speed, reliability, and accessibility of 
                    static content. This back to basics' approach prioritizes typography, 
                    whitespace, and readability over flashy animations. It reminds us that at 
                    its core, the web is about reading and connecting with ideas.
